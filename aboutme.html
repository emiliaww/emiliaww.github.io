    <h2>about me</h2>
    I&#39;m Emilia Wang, an astrologer and tarot reader. I started studying astrology on my own in 2015, and began to take classes and attend conferences over the past few years, organized by astrologers and groups such as<a href="http://www.alicesparklykat.com/"> Alice Sparkly Kat</a>, Queer Astrology Conference, and Astrology University. I began my study of tarot in 2016, initiated by my friend and long-time collaborator <a href="https://cargocollective.com/agustinezegers"> Agustine Zegers</a>.<br /><br>
I write monthly horoscopes. You can read them on (<a href="https://emiliawang.substack.com/">substack</a><br /><br>

<br>
<h2>my approach</h2>
I believe in astrology as a tool for liberation.<br />
<br />
My relationship with astrology is a way to reclaim time and purpose, away from the Gregorian calendar, the 9 to 5 workweek, and hyper productivity. Astrology is a useful framework that shows we are all snapshots in the ever-evolving fractal of time.<br />
<br />
I aim in each consultation space to help each client learn self-knowledge. In that self-knowledge is the knowledge about our communities, the rhythm of our social movements, our ecosystems, and our universe. I also believe astrological work can rescale the individual-collective axis and time continuums, that are sickened in United States and many capitalist societies.<br />
<br />
As someone with the sun in the 6th house I&#39;ve had many difficult learning experiences in defining myself through productivity and busy-ness, &quot;project&quot; after &quot;project&quot; that was never fully thought through but mindlessly churned out. As someone with the moon in the 8th, I&#39;ve faced myself as I rushed through uncontrollable emotions from hatred and fear to love and over-idealization and back, and all of it occurring in self-sabotaging ways.<br />
<br />
The 6th and 8th house are traditionally considered by astrologers to be &quot;bad houses,&quot; areas of a home that receive no light, hidden corners you can&#39;t see from the entrance. But for me, I see them as fugitive spaces, where dominant structures can be deconstructed and new self-made self-loving conditions, not rules, can preside. In the consultation space, we can work together for fugitive planets and parts of you to become alight.<br />
<br />
My approach combines Western modern astrology with a variety of Hellenistic techniques. For those of Taoist-practicing backgrounds, I am training to eventually offer Chinese astrology readings and personalized sigils upon request. The consultation setting is similar to a counseling session -- you bring what you are facing, and I bring astrological perspectives to help you work through ideas and possibilities. We engage in active dialogue. As an astrologer, I prefer not to work as a psychic and push information down on you from top-down. However, if you do desire certain answers that astrology cannot provide, I can combine a tarot reading along with the session.<br />
